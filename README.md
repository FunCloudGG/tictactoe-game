# Tic Tac Toe (C++ | Visual Studio Project)

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C++ as a personal learning project.

The base template (file structure and filenames) was provided by classmates, but all game logic and code were fully written by me.

## Features

- Player vs Player mode  
- Player vs Bot mode with 3 difficulty levels:
  - Easy: bot plays completely random  
  - Medium: bot randomly chooses between smart and dumb moves  
  - Hard: bot mostly tries to block or win (still has randomness)  
- Console interface using Windows-specific features  
- Background music (not included due to GitHub file size limits)

## How to Run

- Open the `.sln` file in **Visual Studio 2019+**
- Make sure you're on **Windows**, as the console features might not work elsewhere
- Build and run the project from Visual Studio

> Note: Music files were not uploaded to GitHub due to file size restrictions (>25MB). You can still add your own `.mp3` or `.wav` files if you want to try it.

## Why this project?

I used this project to learn C++ basics and how to work with:
- Windows console input/output
- Game loops and turn logic
- Simple decision trees (primitive AI)
